      <p>I created Bohemica.com to put into one place a variety of things I've
      been working on (with the help of many friends) for some time now. The
      mission of Bohemica.com is to provide as much information for the student
      of Czech language and culture as possible. I'm afraid it will never
      contain all (it just makes for a catchy banner).</p>
      <p>Bohemica.com is a dot.commercial web site only in the loosest possible
      sense of the word. It now costs about 300 dollars a year to run (excluding all
      computer software and hardware as well as labor) and if a lot of people
      buy books using the links in the <a href=bookstore>Bookstore</a> it
      may just about pay for about a tenth of the cost (after 9 months it has
      generated about $25). There are no banners on the website at the moment. See box <b>Looking for
      sponsors</b>.</p>
                <p>The materials are free for all to use. Just make sure you mention
      Bohemica.com, if you want to reuse some of the content for not-for-profit
                purposes (including private tutoring). <a href=\"contact/contactmain.htm\">Contact</a>
                me if you would like to know about commercial use of the
                materials. Some pages may have
      other limitations imposed on them if other contributors so desire.</p>
      <p>If you have any comments about the site design and content, please <a href=\"contact/contactmain.htm\">contact</a>
      me.</p>

                      aspects of keeping Bohemica.com online with my own money.
                      I don't mind doing that but it means that the current set
                      up is patchy and I cannot make any long-term investment in
                      Bohemica's online presence. <b>Plan:</b> I would like to
                      rent a virtual server so that I can focus on the
                      development of interactive materials which is hard on my
                      current setup. Roughly $1500 dollars would buy about 3
                      years of online webspace sufficient for all Bohemica's
                      needs. More program development also needs some investment
                      but I hope it will be covered by the online course which
                      has generated some interest but so far no funds. <b>Sponsorship
                      opportunities: </b>The traffic on Bohemica.com is slim
                      (typically less than a hundred hits a day) but it is
                      highly specialized. I could offer a sponsor a continuous
                      display of advertisement for an extended period for
                      comparatively little money. But in fact any sponsorship
                      would be more charity than a business investment.</p>
