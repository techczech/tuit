      <p>I created Bohemica.com to put into one place a variety of things I've
      been working on (with the help of many friends) for some time now. The
      mission of Bohemica.com is to provide as much information for the student
      of Czech language and culture as possible. I'm afraid it will never
      contain all (it just makes for a catchy banner).</p>
      <p>Bohemica.com is a dot.commercial web site only in the loosest possible
      sense of the word. It now costs about 300 dollars a year to run (excluding all
      computer software and hardware as well as labor) and if a lot of people
      buy books using the links in the <a href=bookstore>Bookstore</a> it
      may just about pay for about a tenth of the cost (after 9 months it has
      generated about $25). Since November 2003, a number of people and organizations have contributed to the upkeep of Bohemica. The total of contributions as of July 2005 is about $180 (depending on exchange rate). See <a href=http://www.bohemica.com/sponsors>Bohemica.com/sponsors</a>. In July 2005, Bohemica.com acquired a sponsor <a href=http://www.stranslation.com>Advanced International Translations</a> which will cover about half of the expenses for running the site for the next couple of years. Bohemica.com is still looking for sponsors, see box <b>Looking for
      sponsors</b>.</p>
                <p>The materials are free for all to use. Just make sure you mention
      Bohemica.com, if you want to reuse some of the content for not-for-profit
                purposes (including private tutoring). <a href=\"contact/contactmain.htm\">Contact</a>
                me if you would like to know about commercial use of the
                materials. Some pages may have
      other limitations imposed on them if other contributors so desire.</p>
      <p>If you have any comments about the site design and content, please <a href=\"contact/contactmain.htm\">contact</a>
      me.</p>

                      aspects of keeping Bohemica.com online with my own money.
                      I don't mind doing that but it means that the current set
                      up is patchy and I cannot make any long-term investment in
                      Bohemica's online presence. <a href=http://www.bohemica.com/sponsors>Sponsors</a> now cover almost a half of basic operating expenses but any development is still up to me. <b>Sponsorship
                      opportunities: </b>The traffic on Bohemica.com is now over 10,000 hits a month and it is
                      highly specialized. One sponsor's banners are already being displayed but more opportunities are available.</p>
